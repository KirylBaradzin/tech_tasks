The marketing department at 'Company name' are under pressure from the Board to justify their marketing expenditure.  Currently they undertake brand tracking and are able to demonstrate brand awareness, salience and equity.  However, they cannot conclusively prove the additional sales that their marketing activity generates.  They also currently have no way of evaluating the impact of their promotions on sales. 

We have committed to undertake an analytics project to evaluate the performance of their marketing mix â€“ providing them with the accountability they require.

We must report back on our findings.  To ensure that the client really benefits from our work, we must include:

1) A brief review of the data
2) Results and actionable recommendations from our analysis, based on what we feel are the key drivers of volume and profit in the future.
3) Anything else we feel is appropriate
