It has been suggested to us that using Customer Lifetime Value to support our decision making would be of great benefit to us. We would like to understand specifically what this measure is and how it could be used in our business.

Please use the attached dataset to prepare a presentation (4-5 slides max) suggesting how this metric might be utilised in our organisation. It would be useful to include cases where you think CLV could be used and how analytics could support those cases and also what you think may be the main drivers of CLV.
